Before you start, just go into the folder OCX and copy all the file to your Windows' System Directory and register it with regsvr32.exe (I really hope you know how to do that)

Ok, When you are checking out my code, I would like to appologize for its messiness and lack of documentation. At the time I am making this I was not really thinking of this at the final product, however due to some problem along the way with other things in my life, I have decided to just release this code.

For those of you who just wanted to see how to use the ICQ ActiveX Control, well looks like you will also have to go thru all the other crap that I put in this code, once again I'm sorry.

But I hope this code will at least help some of you out there. For those who still dont understand about the ICQ ActiveX Control, it looks like you will just have to wait a bit longer until I actually make a written documentation.
